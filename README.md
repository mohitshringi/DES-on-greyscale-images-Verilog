# DES-on-greyscale-images-Verilog
* These are codes which can perform Encryption-Decryption scheme for various modes of operation on DES (Data Encryption Standard).
* They perform encryption and decryption on greyscale images.
* Language used is Verilog. 
* The software used was Vivado, to which input or output had to be done through binary/hexadecimal/octal(/or other base systems). So some Python libraries were also used. 
* Python codes were used to convert input greyscale images to binary/hexadecimal string and convert the output binary/hexadecimal string to greyscale image.   
* The repo has all the encryption-decryption scheme codes for the different modes of DES as separate modules.
* Also has a sample test bench for one the modes. Any/some/all of the modules can be called in the test bench to perform the desired encryption-decryption.
* These are a part of a solution to a problem statement of an event/competition I participated in.
* The problem statement and sample greyscale image have also been uploaded.
